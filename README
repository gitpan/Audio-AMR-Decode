NAME
    Audio::AMR::Decode - Perl extension do decode .amr files

SYNOPSIS
      use Audio::AMR::Decode;
      Audio::AMR::Decode::amr2raw('infile.amr', 'outfile.pcm');

DESCRIPTION
    This module will attempt to decode an amr encoded audio file to a raw
    pcm audio encoded file.

    The package contains C-source files for the optimized fixed-point speech
    decoder. The optimized fixed-point speech decoder is bit-exact with 3GPP
    TS 26.073 fixed-point speech decoder version 4.1.0.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
	
CAVEATS
    Technically this works but I wouldn't call this code 'mature'. Proceed
    with caution
